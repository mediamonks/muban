Muban is a backend-agnostic framework and development setup to enhance server-rendered HTML with
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) or [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) components and
[SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) stylesheets.

During development, [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) will supply fast compilation and hot
reloading, while using [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) templates to render everything.

The dist build will generates preview html pages and a js and css bundle that backend developers can
use to integrate the pages in their server side templates or CMS of choice.
