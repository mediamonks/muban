# Transitions and animations

Adding animations to your project could make your project feel more alive and sometimes CSS
animations are just not enough.

This is where the
[muban-transition-component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/muban-transition-component) comes into
place. It uses [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/) to create timelines that can be nested to create
super complex animations that are triggered when the components enter the viewport.

For a full implementation guide see the
[setup instructions](https://github.com/riccoarntz/muban-transition-component/wiki).
