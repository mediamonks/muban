## publicPath

The publicPath is the location your assets are retrieved from. The default is set to `/`.
When you deploy your site into a nested folder, you want to change the publicPath to that folder.
This can be done by passing the `--publicPath` flag:
```
yarn build --publicPath=/nested/folder/
```

When you don't know the publicPath during build time, you can also set it at runtime by setting
the `webpackPublicPath` variable on the window before any script file is loaded:
```html
<script>
  window.webpackPublicPath = '/nested/folder/';
  // or
  window.webpackPublicPath = 'https://cdn-domain.site.com/nested/folder/';
</script>
```
